##A procedural music generator that allows you to create configurations to generate and edit music in real-time for your  game. 

## Features
- Over 100+ instruments and percussion to choose from.

- UI Editor included to create configurations with base settings and instruments.  Export configurations to load and edit via scripting in your project.

- Control the tempo, key, mode, scale, dynamics, effects, and dozens of other settings to customize the music to your scene and adapt to your gameplay in real-time. 

- Pre-make and save specific clips to play as SFX at any time.

- Import custom instrument samples.

- Edit instrument or global audio effects

- The perfect solution for quick and custom game jam music!

## Demo:
### Please download the editor to see if it will suit your needs (while I think it's a fine generator, it's by no means a 1-1 replacement for custom music by a composer). The downloads below will allow you to create and play configurations but does not support incorporating those configurations into your game or app. For the full generator please visit the unity asset store page [here](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/99791)
